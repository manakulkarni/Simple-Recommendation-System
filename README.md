# Simple-Recommendation-System
This is a Simple Recommendation System built as a part of a challenge for Fellowship.AI

It has been performed on the MovieLens dataset.
1) The Simple Recommender: Just filter the movies based on their popularity/ratings and we are good to go. All we need to do is load them up on Pandas and sort them.
2) Recommendation Based on Collaborative Filtering: The basic difference between this method and the next method is pretty simple. Collaborative Filtering is based on either
the similarity in preferences, tastes and choices of two users. It analyses how similar the tastes of one user is to another and makes recommendations on the basis of that.
the similarity in between two items. In this case factors like genre come into play.
3) Recommendation Based on Content Based Filtering: Content based filtering is based on the users choice of products. If you like the TV Series Game of Thrones thn you might like the series Vikings
